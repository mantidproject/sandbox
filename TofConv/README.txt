This has been adopted into the main Mantid repository as a Mantid interface. TofConverter from version 2.2.

Attempt to test uploader.

I found a strange 500 internal error. Investigating.

Upload again. Still 500.


Another. Again. And again.
It was lacking the last }

I've added the last }, but it is still repeating the output twice.

Now I will test the result to check the real status of the upload.
