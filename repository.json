    "description": "A thin Mantid algorithm wrapper around an F2Py-compiled version of the Fortran\n\"MaxEnt\" program, which is currently being used from within OpenGENIE.\n\nThe existing functionality of the OpenGENIE version was to specify a run number\nand several options, and have the program do its calculations and plot the result.\nThere were also three files given to the program containing groupings as well as\nphase and deadtime data.  These were updated after the program had run its course.\n\nWe try to do the same here, except that we can work out a few of the options\nourselves without having to ask the user for them.  We also supply the plotted\ndata as an OutputWorkspace for users to play with.\n\nAnother difference is that in most cases we are removing the responsiblity of\nthe Fortran to write to and read from files; doing this via Python is easier\nand a lot more robust (doesn't crash if it can't get access rights).\n\nWe're supplying this via the Script Repository to keep F2Py out of the main one.\nThe main disadvantage to this is that we will have to run the unit tests manually\nafter every change to make sure things haven't regressed.  Another potential\ndownside is that this script requires users to add the containing directory to\ntheir \"Python extensions\" in Mantid preferences.  This will mean that the .pyd\nwill be used (locked) by the Mantid process and so updating it via the script\nrepository will not be possible without first removing the directory again from\nthe preferences.\n\nExample usage (SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITH TESTING AND FEEDBACK FROM USERS):\n\n# Execute with default input files, for the run \"48033\" on \"MUSR\".\nresult = MaxEnt(RunNumber=\"48033\", Instrument=\"MUSR\")",
